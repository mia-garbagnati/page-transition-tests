# page-transition-tests
Testing out different animated page transitions

# Notes:

##### Page 1:

- From [here](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2017/08/08/morphing-page-transition/)
- Uses [anime.js](http://animejs.com/)
- Transition: Intro page moves up with wide, wavy, liquidy bottom border to intro page

##### Page 2:

- From [here](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2017/08/08/morphing-page-transition/)
- Uses [anime.js](http://animejs.com/)
- Transition: Similar to pg1, but wavy line is more wavy

##### Page 3:

- From [here](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2017/08/08/morphing-page-transition/)
- Uses [anime.js](http://animejs.com/)
- Transition: Intro page moves up using some elasticity animation to give the illusion of a stretchy, bubble gum-ish screen sliding up. This transition also tweens the color of the intro page background to a lighter shade as the page transitions.
